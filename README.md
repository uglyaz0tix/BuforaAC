## ðŸ”’ About BuforaAC

Bufora is the next-generation anti-cheat solution for Linux games, engineered to provide unprecedented protection against modern cheating techniques. 

### Our Security Philosophy
```mermaid

    A[Closed-Source] --> B[Obfuscation]
    B --> C[Anti-Reversing]
    C --> D[Secure Kernel Modules]
    D --> E[Runtime Protection]
Written in ASM/C/C++: Leveraging low-level capabilities for maximum performance and security

Source Code Protection: Full source will not be publicly available to prevent vulnerability analysis

Defense-in-Depth: Multi-layered protection against memory scanning and reverse engineering

Active Obfuscation: Continuously evolving code protection mechanisms

Anti-Tamper: Self-protecting modules that detect and prevent modification attempts

Why Closed Source?
We believe that anti-cheat security requires a balanced approach:

Code

Prevents cheat developers from studying detection mechanisms

Protects proprietary algorithms and signature databases

Maintains integrity of kernel-level protections

Ensures long-term effectiveness against evolving threats

For Game Developers
While the core remains closed, we provide:

Clean API for integration

Documentation for implementation

SDK with sample protections

Customizable rule sets

Regular security updates

"Security through obscurity alone is insufficient, but combined with our active protection layers, it creates a formidable defense system." - BuforaAC Team
